# ✈️ Flight Delays and Cancellations Analysis Using Data Science

This project aims to analyze **airline transportation data** by examining **flight trends, delays, and airport performance**. **SQL and Python** were used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## 🔍 Project Overview

📌 **Dataset and Sources**  
This project utilizes a dataset containing flight information, including airlines, airports, flight schedules, delays, and cancellations.  

📌 **Data Preprocessing Steps**  
- Identified and cleaned missing data.  
- Standardized date formats and transformed time-based data for analysis.  
- Encoded categorical variables for meaningful insights.  

📌 **Conducted Analyses**  
- **Flight Trend Analysis**: Analyzed flight volumes by month and day.  
- **Delay Analysis**: Identified airlines and airports with the highest delays.  
- **Cancellation Rates**: Determined which airlines had the most frequent cancellations.  
- **Hourly Delay Analysis**: Examined the hours of the day with the most flight delays.  
- **Airport Performance Comparison**: Evaluated the fastest and most delay-prone airports.  

📌 **Findings and Insights**  
- Increased delay rates were observed during specific hours.  
- Identified the airports and airlines with the highest delays.  
- Analyzed the peak periods for flight cancellations.  

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL)** – For querying and analyzing flight data  
- **Pandas & NumPy** – For data processing and analysis  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – For visualizing flight data  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – For organizing and executing code
